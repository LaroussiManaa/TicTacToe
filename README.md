# ticTacToe
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe android game.

Everybody knows how to play Tic-Tac-Toe: a 3×3 array of tiles, initially empty,
is filled in by two players who mark either an X or an O in an empty spot.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins. If the board fills up
first, then that’s a tie and nobody wins.

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe  is similar, except that you can’t simply put a mark in
your square—you have to win the square by playing a nested game of TicTac-Toe using a 3×3 array of smaller tiles inside the big one.

Enjoy!
